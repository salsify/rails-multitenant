Unreleased ([changes](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/compare/v0.7.0...master))
-------------------

v0.7.1, 2012-10-12 ([changes](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/compare/v0.7.0...v0.7.1))
-------------------

  * [BUGFIX] The gem packages of 0.7.0 (both simplecov and simplecov-html) pushed to Rubygems had some file
    permission issues, leading to problems when installing SimpleCov in a root/system Rubygems install and then
    trying to use it as a normal user (see https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/issues/171, thanks @envygeeks
    for bringing it up). The gem build process has been changed to always enforce proper permissions before packaging
    to avoid this issue in the future.


v0.7.0, 2012-10-10 ([changes](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/compare/v0.6.4...v0.7.0))
-------------------

  * [FEATURE] The new `maximum_coverage_drop` and `minimum_coverage` now allow you to fail your build when the
    coverage dropped by more than what you allowed or is below a minimum value required. Also, `refuse_coverage_drop` disallows
    any coverage drops between test runs.
    See https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/151, https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/issues/11,
    https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/issues/90, and https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/issues/96 (thanks to @infertux)
  * [FEATURE] SimpleCov now ships with a built-in MultiFormatter which allows the easy usage of multiple result formatters at
    the same time without the need to write custom wrapper code.
    See https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/158 (thanks to @nikitug)
  * [BUGFIX] The usage of digits, hyphens and underscores in group names could lead to broken tab navigation
    in the default simplecov-html reports. See https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov-html/pull/14 (thanks to @ebelgarts)
  * [REFACTORING] A few more ruby warnings removed. See https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/issues/106 and
    https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/139. (thanks to @lukejahnke)
  * A [Pledgie button](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/commit/63cfa99f8658fa5cc66a38c83b3195fdf71b9e93) for those that
    feel generous :)
  * The usual bunch of README fixes and documentation tweaks. Thanks to everyone who contributed those!

v0.6.4, 2012-05-10 ([changes](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/compare/v0.6.3...v0.6.4))
-------------------

  * [BUGFIX]Â Encoding issues with ISO-8859-encoded source files fixed.
    See https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/117. (thanks to @Deradon)
  * [BUGFIX] Ensure ZeroDivisionErrors won't occur when calculating the coverage result, which previously
    could happen in certain cases. See https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/128. (thanks to @japgolly)
  * [REFACTORING] Changed a couple instance variable lookups so SimpleCov does not cause a lot of warnings when
    running ruby at a higher warning level. See https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/issues/106 and
    https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/119. (thanks to @mvz and @gioele)


v0.6.3, 2012-05-10 ([changes](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/compare/v0.6.2...v0.6.3))
-------------------

  * [BUGFIX] Modified the API-changes for newer multi_json versions introduced with #122 and v0.6.2 so
    they are backwards-compatible with older multi_json gems in order to avoid simplecov polluting
    the multi_json minimum version requirement for entire applications.
    See https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/issues/132
  * Added appraisal gem to the test setup in order to run the test suite against both 1.0 and 1.3
    multi_json gems and ensure the above actually works :)

v0.6.2, 2012-04-20 ([changes](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/compare/v0.6.1...v0.6.2))
-------------------

  * [Updated to latest version of MultiJSON and its new API (thanks to @sferik and @ronen).
    See https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/122

v0.6.1, 2012-02-24 ([changes](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/compare/v0.6.0...v0.6.1))
-------------------

  * [BUGFIX] Don't force-load Railtie on Rails < 3. Fixes regression introduced with
    #83. See https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/issues/113

v0.6.0, 2012-02-22 ([changes](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/compare/v0.5.4...v0.6.0))
-------------------

  * [FEATURE] Auto-magic `rake simplecov` task for rails
    (see https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/83, thanks @sunaku)
  * [BUGFIX] Treat source files as UTF-8 to avoid encoding errors
    (see https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/103, thanks @joeyates)
  * [BUGFIX] Store the invoking terminal command right after loading so they are safe from
    other libraries tampering with ARGV. Among other makes automatic Rails test suite splitting
    (Unit/Functional/Integration) work with recent rake versions again
    (see https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/issues/110)
  * [FEATURE] If guessing command name from the terminal command fails, try guessing from defined constants
    (see https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/commit/37afca54ef503c33d888e910f950b3b943cb9a6c)
  * Some refactorings and cleanups as usual. Please refer to the github compare view for a full
    list of changes: https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/compare/v0.5.4...v0.6.0

v0.5.4, 2011-10-12 ([changes](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/compare/v0.5.3...v0.5.4))
-------------------

  * Do not give exit code 0 when there are exceptions prior to tests
    (see https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/issues/41, thanks @nbogie)
  * The API for building custom filter classes is now more obvious, using #matches? instead of #passes? too.
    (see https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/issues/85, thanks @robinroestenburg)
  * Mailers are now part of the Rails adapter as their own group (see
    https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/issues/79, thanks @geetarista)
  * Removed fix for JRuby 1.6 RC1 float bug because it's been fixed
    (see https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/issues/86)
  * Readme formatted in Markdown :)

v0.5.3, 2011-09-13 ([changes](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/compare/v0.5.2...v0.5.3))
-------------------

  * Fix for encoding issues that came from the nocov processing mechanism
    (see https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/issues/71)
  * :nocov: lines are now actually being reflected in the HTML report and are marked in yellow.

  * The Favicon in the HTML report is now determined by the overall coverage and will have the color
    that the coverage percentage gets as a css class to immediately indicate coverage status on first sight.

  * Introduced SimpleCov::SourceFile::Line#status method that returns the coverage status
    as a string for this line - made SimpleCov::HTML use that.
  * Refactored nocov processing and made it configurable using SimpleCov.ncov_token (or it's
    alias SimpleCov.skip_token)

v0.5.2, 2011-09-12 ([changes](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/compare/v0.5.1...v0.5.2))
-------------------

  * Another fix for a bug in JSON processing introduced with MultiJSON in 0.5.1
    (see https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/75, thanks @sferik)

v0.5.1, 2011-09-12 ([changes](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/compare/v0.5.0...v0.5.1))
-------------------
**Note: Yanked 2011-09-12 because the MultiJSON-patch had a crucial bug**

  * Fix for invalid gemspec dependency string (see https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/70,
    http://blog.rubygems.org/2011/08/31/shaving-the-yaml-yacc.html, thanks @jspradlin)

  * Added JSON in the form of the multi_json gem as dependency for those cases when built-in JSON
    is unavailable (see https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/issues/72
    and https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/74, thanks @sferik)

v0.5.0, 2011-09-09 ([changes](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/compare/v0.4.2...v0.5.4))
-------------------
**Note: Yanked 2011-09-09 because of trouble with the gemspec.**

  * JSON is now used instead of YAML for resultset caching (used for merging). Should resolve
    a lot of problems people used to have because of YAML parser errors.

  * There's a new adapter 'test_frameworks'. Use it outside of Rails to remove `test/`,
    `spec/`, `features/` and `autotest/` dirs from your coverage reports, either directly
    with `SimpleCov.start 'test_frameworks'` or with `SimpleCov.load_adapter 'test_frameworks'`

  * SimpleCov configuration can now be placed centrally in a text file `.simplecov`, which will
    be automatically read on `require 'simplecov'`. This makes using custom configuration like
    groups and filters across your test suites much easier as you only have to specify your config
    once. Just put the whole `SimpleCov.start (...)` code into `APP_ROOT/.simplecov`

  * Lines can now be skipped by using the :nocov: flag in comments that wrap the code that should be
    skipped, like in this example (thanks @phillipkoebbe)

    <pre>
      #:nocov:
      def skipped
    	  @foo * 2
      end
      #:nocov:
    </pre>

  * Moved file set coverage analytics from simplecov-html to SimpleCov::FileList, a new subclass
    of Array that is always returned for SourceFile lists (i.e. in groups) and can now be used
    in all formatters without the need to roll your own.

  * The exceptions you used to get after removing some code and re-running your tests because SimpleCov
    couldn't find the cached source lines should be resolved (thanks @goneflyin)

  * Coverage strength metric: Average hits/line per source file and result group (thanks @trans)

  * Finally, SimpleCov has an extensive Cucumber test suite

  * Full compatibility with Ruby 1.9.3.preview1

### HTML Formatter:

  * The display of source files has been improved a lot. Weird scrolling trouble, out-of-scope line hit counts
    and such should be a thing of the past. Also, it is prettier now.
  * Source files are now syntax highlighted
  * File paths no longer have that annoying './' in front of them
