# Making Contributions

To fetch & test the library for development, do:

    $ git clone https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov.git
    $ cd simplecov
    $ bundle
    $ rake appraisal:install
    $ rake appraisal

For more information on the appraisal gem (for testing against multiple gem dependency versions), please see
https://github.com/thoughtbot/appraisal/

If you want to contribute, please:

  * Fork the project.
  * Make your feature addition or bug fix.
  * Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
  * **Bonus Points** go out to anyone who also updates `CHANGELOG.md` :)
  * Send me a pull request on Github.
